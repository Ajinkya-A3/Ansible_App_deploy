# Ansible Flask Web App Deployment with Monitoring

## 📘 Overview
This project automates the deployment of a Flask-based To-Do web application on GCP VM instances using **Ansible**. 
It includes roles for system hardening, user creation, web server setup, and monitoring with Node Exporter.

The architecture ensures consistent configuration, security best practices, and monitoring support — all through Ansible automation.

---

## 🧩 Roles Breakdown

### 1️⃣ users
- Creates a dedicated `devops` user for deployment instead of using the default `root` user.
- Adds the `devops` user to the sudo group for administrative tasks.
- Disables root password-based SSH to enforce key-based authentication for improved security.

### 2️⃣ security
- Ensures SSH password login is disabled.
- Applies essential system security configurations (e.g., disables root login, ensures sudo permissions, and locks down unnecessary access).
- Skips UFW for GCP VMs, as firewall rules are handled via GCP network settings.

### 3️⃣ webserver
- Installs and configures **Nginx**, **Python3**, and **Gunicorn**.
- Deploys the Flask To-Do app from a GitHub repository.
- Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy to serve the Flask app via Gunicorn.
- Creates a systemd service to ensure the Flask app automatically starts on boot.

### 4️⃣ monitoring
- Deploys **Node Exporter** to expose system metrics for Prometheus.
- Runs Node Exporter as a background service managed by systemd.
- Enables monitoring for CPU, memory, and disk usage.

## ⚙️ Playbooks

### `bootstrap.yaml`
Used for initial setup:
- Creates `devops` user.
- Copies SSH keys.
- Prepares the system for Ansible connection.

### `playbook.yaml`
Main deployment playbook:
- Runs all roles ( `security`, `webserver`, `monitoring`) sequentially to set up the full stack.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Update inventory**
   ```bash
   [web]
   <your-server-ip> ansible_user=<your-initial-ssh-user>
   ```

2. **Run bootstrap playbook**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini bootstrap.yaml
   ```

3. **Run main playbook**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yaml
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Visit: `http://<your-server-ip>`

---

## 📊 Monitoring
Once deployed, Node Exporter exposes metrics at:  
`http://<your-server-ip>:9100/metrics`

You can integrate this with Prometheus for real-time system monitoring.

---

## 🛡️ Security Practices
- SSH password authentication disabled.
- Dedicated user for deployments.
- Key-based SSH for secure access.

---

## 🧠 Future Enhancements
- Add Prometheus & Grafana deployment for visual monitoring.
- Integrate CI/CD using GitHub Actions.
- Extend Flask app with MySQL database support.
